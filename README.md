# Student Management 
The Student Management System, developed collaboratively by a team of four, is a web-based application designed to efficiently manage and process student data. Leveraging Flask, a Python web framework, this system utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development.

Key features include dynamic data processing through user input, enabling real-time updates and calculations. Particularly, the system provides robust functionality for updating student attendance records, facilitating clear differentiation between present and absent students.

This project serves as a practical implementation for the Software Lab Project, showcasing the integration of various technologies to achieve a comprehensive solution for student data management.
To run this application:

```
flask --debug run
```
